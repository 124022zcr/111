    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is interesting. As an important model, Bertrand-Edgeworth model shed light on the behavior of firms in competition in which capacity is endogenous. This framework enables economists to analyze the market competition in a more complex scenario. In most of Betrand-Edgeworth models, there are symmetric equilibria, such as Kreps & Sheinkman (1983). And in some models, pure strategy equilibrium does not exist. Reynolds & Wilson (2000) is one of the few models with asymmetric pure strategy equilibrium with demand uncertainty. This model can help to analyze the competitions between firms with different capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of competition is very common in reality. Furthermore, some important competition strategies may happen in this case, such as predatory buying. This model provide a good way to further people’s understanding on these strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Kreps & Sheinkman’s paper (2000), although the asymmetric pure strategy equilibria exist, it is too difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the model in a simple way of calculating. So actually, they did not provide the analytical solutions of this model in their results. This can be an obstacle for the analysis that focuses on scenario that this model intend to depict or even more complicated cases. In this assignment, we hope to use python to find the analytical solutions of this. Our conclusion will be instrumental in understanding this model.\n"
